SafeO ERP Protection Layer
===========================
SafeO is a real-time risk decision engine that lives *inside* Odoo — not in
front of it.

**Hackathon Theme: Business, Finance, and Workforce ERP**

How it works
------------
1. A CRM lead is created → SafeO intercepts it, calls the risk engine,
   scores it 0-100, and blocks it if it contains injection payloads.
2. A financial action (payment, approval) is submitted → risk scored before
   the ERP executes it.
3. An employee action is logged → behavioral anomaly detection flags
   suspicious patterns.
4. Network context (safe / risky) boosts risk scores automatically.
5. All decisions are stored in ``safeo.erp.decision`` — queryable from any
   Odoo view, report, or automation.

ERP Modules Protected
---------------------
- **CRM** — lead/contact form inputs scanned for injection attacks
- **Finance** — payment and approval notes evaluated for anomalous intent
- **HR / Workforce** — employee activity monitored for behavioral drift
- **Auth** — every login/logout captured in the ERP Audit Trail
- **Website** — contact and signup forms protected at submission

Architecture
-----------
- FastAPI decision engine (port 8001) holds the ML risk scorer + tiered LLM
- Odoo module connects via ``securec.api_url`` setting (ir.config_parameter)
- All ERP decisions written to ``safeo.erp.decision`` (native Odoo model)
- Dashboard built with OWL 3 (Odoo's native frontend framework)

    # - mail: for internal Odoo bus notifications on high-risk events
    # website_sale: cart code paths assume env.user; /web/login + website.layout needs a fix
